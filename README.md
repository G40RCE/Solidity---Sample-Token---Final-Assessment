# Code-Walkthrough 
Sample Token - VIVA Solidity

Descriptions:

1. The proper use of a token will be increment or decrement on their coin values will update on their necessary details thru storing variables.

2. All store values are preset to public variables and values (all code assets are readily accessable rather than private method means only limited to a local variables will not work on any outside variables).

3. The mapping method will run and return to the value address, where the user could input the amount and gives a specific tokens that are deducted or added from the time where you compile and deploy all of the codes were functional.

4. Lastly, all of their calling public variables are stored into a main file (not transmitting thru a network that accesses the spending a token). This means the sample token will run only a local solidity file unless make sure to set their desired gas limit and copy specific address to your account from deploy and run transaction might not affect any sensitive information is cannot be possible.
